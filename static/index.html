            It is your unique combination of skills and experiences that make
            you who you are, and what others will recognize you for, so
            effective personal branding should differentiate you from other
            professionals in your field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Effective personal branding is of pivotal importance, especially if
            it is essential to advancing your career. Therefore, one should be
            aware of what it is that you are communicating that may be
            preventing you from breeding a successful career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two critical factors result in effective branding:
            <i>authenticity</i> and <i>credibility.</i>

            Most entrepreneurs understand the importance of branding when it
            comes to business. Building a well recognized and respected business
            brand ads tremendous value and can create a significant competitive
            advantage. Just ask

            Personal branding, or the practice of individuals marketing
            themselves and their careers as brands, may seem to many an exercise
            in vanity. Doing things to promote yourself, such as having a
            personal website, a portfolio of professional headshots and an
            on-the-go personal pitch, is often considered the routine of
            self-interested people, from well-known celebrities to the annoying
            co-workers who boasts about themselves nonstop in the breakroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Done properly, however, a personal brand can be much more (or less)
            than just self-promotion. It can be a personal -- and private --
            exercise in establishing confidence, credibility and courage as well
            as help you define priorities and focus on those aspects of your
            life you enjoy most.

            The relationship between brands and consumers is dynamic and must be
            constantly refined. This continuous process demonstrates the
            ambivalence of consumerism. A personal brand may make itself
            appealing to companies in order to reinforce its visibility and
            increase its chance of receiving a sponsorship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personal brands may be deliberately modified to reinvent a public
            persona. This may be to recover from a public embarrassment, or to
            re-emerge from obscurity. The public perception of authenticity
            often determines the success of a rebranding
          </p>
